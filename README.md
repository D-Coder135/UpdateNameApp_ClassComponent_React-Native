# UpdateNameApp_ClassComponent_React-Native

## This is a hybrid-application build using React-Native and JavaScript. This application updates the Name using Class component. As soon as the user provides a new Name in the TextInput tag and presses the Update Name button, the name gets updated. The code for the application is written in JavaScript Language with the use of the React-Native framework.

### Topics I covered while building the application:-
- React-Native Class Components.
- React-Native state variables.
- setState() function in React-Native
- Internal and Inline Styling In React-Native.
- TextInput component in React-Native.
- Call back and Anonymous functions in React-Native.
- Button Component In React-Native.
